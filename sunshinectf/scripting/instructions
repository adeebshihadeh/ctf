Some of our file systems have been corrupted recently, we need
your help to find which folders are corrupted.
------------------------------------------------------------

You will be placed in the file systems one by one and you will
need to navigate through the systems. You will see some of
the folders have contents whose sizes don't add up to the same
size of the folder they are in. We need you to find these folders.

There are three available commands:
cd [destination] - Change working directory to destination
ls [destination] - List contents of destination, Leave destination blank for ./
                    Lists contents of destination in the form:
                    [destination]: (number of contents)
                    entry_name entry_type entry_size
                    An example:
                    /: $ ls fdsk
                    fdsk: (2 entries)
                    tfi   DIR  43294
                    abdka FILE 9543
send [destination] - Send destination as an answer, if you get a folder wrong
                        you get kicked out of the system!
    
Below is an example.
------------------------------------------------------------

/: $ ls
/: (4 entries)
xkkgj   DIR  7450
ddh     FILE 2
uijuse  FILE 4
kiua    FILE 5
/: $ cd xkkgj
/xkkgj: $ ls
/xkkgj: (5 entries)
qoj     DIR  7
vrikuw  DIR  31
krqg    DIR  4150
vlqhe   FILE 1
jfkmaev DIR  3261
/xkkgj: $ cd qoj
/xkkgj/qoj: $ ls
/xkkgj/qoj: (4 entries)
sepk    FILE 2
ybwi    FILE 3
ecoxtam FILE 1
rlmav   FILE 1
/xkkgj/qoj: $ cd ..
/xkkgj: $ cd vrikuw
/xkkgj/vrikuw: $ ls
/xkkgj/vrikuw: (8 entries)
jns     FILE 4
eaqps   FILE 5
pwdq    FILE 4
rosopj  FILE 5
whicb   FILE 3
gbekky  FILE 4
xvumook FILE 1
btliuft FILE 5
/xkkgj/vrikuw: $ cd ..
/xkkgj: $ cd krqg
/xkkgj/krqg: $ ls
/xkkgj/krqg: (10 entries)
pgfd    FILE 3
bpdi    FILE 4
xpgswzo FILE 5
tyynmoi FILE 1
hqky    FILE 3
pgn     FILE 3
jlnxx   FILE 5
gsmyl   FILE 5
ucarx   FILE 1
epueuow FILE 3
/xkkgj/krqg: $ cd ..
/xkkgj: $ send krqg
Correct!
/xkkgj: $ cd jfkmaev
/xkkgj/jfkmaev: $ ls
/xkkgj/jfkmaev: (10 entries)
qlyq    FILE 3
nzp     FILE 4
vmiai   FILE 4
eayv    FILE 4
ztql    FILE 4
pddu    FILE 1
adf     FILE 5
ejwrlhy FILE 5
fveby   FILE 5
vreqfv  FILE 2
/xkkgj/jfkmaev: $ send .
Correct!
Hooray! You found all the corrupted folders!
Now on to the next system

Notice in the example that /xkkgj/krpg is one of the corrupt folders but /xkkgj
is not. The /xkkgj's size matches the sum of the files and directories under it
including with /xkkgj/krpg's incorrect size, in this case /xkkgj is not
considered wrong.
